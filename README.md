- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on writing research articles based on film adaptations of literary texts and how they can be used as a good pedagogical aid.
-  I am trying to write uality articles with proper citation and refernce on topics like problems faced by students pursuing higher education in the form of job unavailibility, development of a utilitarian oriented curriculum in English literature in Masters level along with the core elemnts of English literature, which will fetch the student a job and at the same time have a solid knowledge on literature, critical theory etc.
